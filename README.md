## **4. Tools & Coding Languages**

The following tools and coding languages were used:
* HTML
* JavaScript (d3)
* Css
* Bootstrap

## **5. Data Source(s)**

The data used as input is coming from the following sources:
* Link to .json file [here](002-Code/Sample/samples.json)


## **6. Run the code**

### **Step 1: The code is located here**
The code is available as follows:
* Part 1: [HTML](index.html)
* Part 2: [JavaScript](002-Code/JavaScript/app.js)
